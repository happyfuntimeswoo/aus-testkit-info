          <h2>Welcome!</h2>

          <p>
              I created this website after my Pluslife order was one of multiple denied entry into Australia at the border due to lack of an import permit - a requirement I was unaware existed. Following this, I have gathered a lot of information from Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry about how to legally and successfully import Pluslife tests into the country.
          </p>

          <p>
              My goal for this website is to collect all the information I have gathered about importing Pluslife tests into Australia into one place, such that legally importing these tests into Australia is as accessible to as many people as possible.

          <h2>Regarding "Australia"</h2>
          <p>
              The laws and import conditions I discuss on this website are the laws of “Australia”, a colony named by white settlers who invaded and committed genocide against the Indigenous people who lived on this country long before them. I pay great respect to Indigenous elders and their kin across this country who have had to navigate the entirety of “Australian” law as it has oppressed them for two and a half centuries.
          </p>

          <p>
              This place always was and always will be Aboriginal land.
