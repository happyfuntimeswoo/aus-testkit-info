        <p>
            Applying for a permit is a fairly simple process, you don’t have to make many choices - it’s mostly just ticking some boxes and paying the $204 processing fee. Once you have been granted a permit, you will be able to import as many Pluslife Tests as you like for the next 5 years.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>
                You can apply for a permit on the Australian Biosecurity Import Conditions website (aka BICON) <a href="https://bicon.agriculture.gov.au/BiconWeb4.0/ImportConditions/Conditions?EvaluatableElementId=792658&Path=UNDEFINED&UserContext=External&EvaluationStateId=90763115-eba7-4f5b-b733-65d6ea591455&CaseElementPk=2335228&EvaluationPhase=ImportDefinition&HasAlerts=True&HasChangeNotices=True&IsAEP=False">here</a> by clicking "Apply Now" at the bottom of the page.
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you'd like assistance, I can offer you this <a href="How-To-Apply-For-Import-Permit.pdf">how-to guide</a> for applying for a permit. <br /><br />
            
            It's a bit wordy, because as well as telling you which boxes to tick it also explains the meaning of the different legal terms, sections of the form, and conditions you’re agreeing to.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also email Ngaio Diagnostics (info@ngaio.co.nz) for assistance with this process if you're planning on ordering from them - they have their own very clear and simple guide they can send you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Regardless of what path you take, <b>I highly suggest you make sure you understand the <a href="https://bicon.agriculture.gov.au/BiconWeb4.0/ImportConditions/Conditions?EvaluatableElementId=792658&Path=UNDEFINED&UserContext=External&EvaluationStateId=90763115-eba7-4f5b-b733-65d6ea591455&CaseElementPk=2335228&EvaluationPhase=ImportDefinition&HasAlerts=True&HasChangeNotices=True&IsAEP=False">requirements</a>. you’ll have to meet when importing Pluslife tests into the country</b>, known as the <b>import conditions</b>.
