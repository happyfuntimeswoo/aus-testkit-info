          <h1 id="header">Using an Import Permit to order Pluslife Tests</h1>
          <h2>An Overview</h2>


          <p>
              For a Pluslife order to legally enter the country, three main things need to happen:
          </p>

          <ol>
              <h4>
              <li>
                  The recipient of the order needs to hold a valid import permit.
              </li>


              </h4>

              <div>
                  <p>
                      To prove to customs that you have an import permit the <b>easiest</b> thing to do is <b>ask the business you are buying the tests from to print out a copy of your permit and attach it to your parcel.</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      However, if your order arrives at customs without a permit attached, this is okay - they will send you a letter telling you to email a copy of it to them. This method will mean that your package will sit around at customs for a few weeks though before getting to you.
                  </p>
              </div>

              <h4>
              <li>
                  The name and address on the order must match the name and address on the import permit.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  The package needs to have a statement from the company selling the tests (eg. Ngaio Diagnostics, Altruan) declaring that the tests meet Australian biosecurity standards. This is called a Manufacturer's Declaration.
              </li>
              </h4>
          </ol>

          <p>The following guide will explain how you can go about meeting these requirements.</p>
          <br />

          <h2>A step-by-step guide to making a Pluslife Order using a permit</h2>

          <ol>
              <li>
                  Get access to an import permit. You can either <a href="apply-for-permit.html">apply for one yourself</a>, or find a friend/community member who has one and is happy to import them for you.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  Write an email to the company you’re buying the tests from (eg. Ngaio Diagnostics, Altruan). There are <b>example emails</b> below that you can copy-paste. This email should:
                  <ul>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                          Inform the company that you want to buy some Pluslife tests
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          Let them know that you have an import permit (you can attach it now, or in a later email if you want to ensure the order is progressing first)
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          Ask them if they are able to print out and physically attach your import permit to your order
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          Ask them if they’re able to write and physically attach an appropriate Manufacturer’s Declaration to your order
                      </li>

                  </ul>
              

                  
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  Once the company has written back to you and confirmed that they can physically attach the Manufacturer’s Declaration and your import permit to the order, follow their instructions for finalising the transaction. Usually this will involve:

                  <ul>
                      <br />
                      <li>
                          You giving them personal details such as name, phone number and address - remember <b>the name and address on your order should match the name and address listed on the import permit. </b>
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          Them sending you an unpaid invoice (known as a "pro forma" invoice) summarising your order items and prices. You can write back to them with any changes you’d like made to your order
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          You paying the invoice via bank transfer or credit card
                      </li>

                  </ul>
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  Your order should then be sent off and make it through customs without issue :)
              </li>
          </ol>
          <br />

                      Hello!
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      I’d like to order some Pluslife tests to Australia using my Australian Biosecurity import permit. To use this permit, I need to ensure that it is physically attached to the outside of the parcel when it enters Australia. Additionally, the goods must also be sent to Australia with a Manufacturer's Declaration attached to the parcel.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      This Manufacturer’s Declaration:
                  </p>

                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          must state that the goods
                          <ul>
                              <li>
                                  are Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA) test kits only (or individual components specifically designed for use with kits eligible for import under these conditions)

                              </li>
                              <br />
                              <li>
                                  contain nucleic acid up to 1000 nucleotides, enzymes and chemical buffers only.
                              </li>

                          </ul>
                      </li>
                      <br />

                      <li>
                          must additionally meet the general requirements for Manufacturer's Declarations for import into Australia, as can be found <a href="https://bicon.agriculture.gov.au/BiconWeb4.0/ImportConditions/ViewCase/DocumentationRequirementMedia?ImportDefinitionPathwayNodePK=164&EvaluatableElementId=792658&Path=UNDEFINED&UserContext=External&EvaluationStateId=b87df8d7-603a-484a-a23f-69d320baf778&CaseElementPk=2335228&EvaluationPhase=ImportConditions&ImportDefinitionPathwaySectionName=Nucleic%20acid%20amplification%20%28e.g.%20PCR%29%20test%20kits%20%28Standard%29&HasAlerts=True&HasChangeNotices=True&IsAEP=False&elementPk=2037731">here</a>.

                  <p>
                      Is this Manufacturer's Declaration something you would be able to write and attach to my order alongside my import permit?
