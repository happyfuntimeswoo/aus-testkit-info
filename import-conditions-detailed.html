        <p>
            The following section goes through each dot-point on the import conditions text - labelled “a.” to “g.” on the <a href="https://bicon.agriculture.gov.au/BiconWeb4.0/ImportConditions/Conditions?EvaluatableElementId=792658&Path=UNDEFINED&UserContext=External&EvaluationStateId=00e028fe-8c5e-43b6-bfbf-03a0ccb72208&CaseElementPk=2335228&EvaluationPhase=ImportDefinition&SubscriptionId=10162&HasAlerts=True&HasChangeNotices=True&IsAEP=False">BICON website</a> - and summarises its contents under each subheading.

            These refer to the conditions that have to be met in order to bring a certain good into Australia

        </p>

        <p>
            Before you bring nucleic acid amplification tests (eg. Pluslife tests) into Australia, you must make sure that:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                You have a valid import permit.
                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        You can fulfil this requirement by applying for and being granted an import permit before ordering tests to Australia.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
                The package coming into Australia is accompanied by a letter from the manufacturer of the tests stating that they meet Australia’s biosecurity standards for nucleic acid amplification tests. This letter is called a Manufacturer’s Declaration. For more information, see: <a href="FAQ.html#declaration-info">What is a Manufacturer's Declaration?</a>.

                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        You can fulfil this requirement by contacting the business you are buying tests from and telling them you need them to place a Manufacturer’s Declaration on your order. See: <a href="use-your-permit.html">How do I use my import permit?</a>.

                    </li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
                The tests are commercially available - ie. made to be sold to and used by people
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you are buying your tests from a business (eg. Altruan or Ngaio Diagnostics), then you are meeting this requirement.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>

            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            These conditions refer to the ways in which you must use and dispose of nucleic acid amplification tests once they are in your possession.
        </p>

        <ol type="a" start="4">
            <li>
                You cannot use the tests for purposes other than intended. Do not take the liquid in the tests - either before or after a test is run - and pour it on or in plants, humans and other animals. Do not use it to intentionally grow, store, or weaponise viruses.
                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        You can meet this requirement by simply following the instructions accompanying the Pluslife tests and disposing of them as described in the instructions after use. Do not use them for purposes other than stated in the instructions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

                    “Additional Information”
                </i>
            </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Other things to know
        </p>

        <ol type="a" start="5">
            <li>
                Your package must be properly labelled.
                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        This is something that reputable businesses should do without you needing to ask.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
                There are various fees that have to be paid to import goods into Australia. To my understanding, the only one of these that applies to the importing of nucleic acid amplification tests is the fee that you have to pay in order to be issued a permit.
            </li>
            <br />

            <li>
                Your package must be properly clean, packaged and generally un-suspicious. They reserve the right to further inspect your package at customs if it is not. (I imagine this might involve opening it)
                <ul>
                    <br />
                    <li>
                        Again, this is something that reputable businesses should fulfill for you without you needing to ask.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
