          <p>The additional wording in this letter was: "it is a condition for these goods that they must not be brought or imported into Australian territory unless an import permit has been granted OR all conditions have been complied with."</p>

          <p>The conditions are as follows: "A letter must be presented with the following evidence: a description of who will be using the tests, and a description of the quantity of goods being imported is no more than three monthsâ€™ supply (for example identify the number of family members being tested and the number of test ms they will require during 3 months)."</p>
