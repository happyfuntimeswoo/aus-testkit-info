              <p>
                  I received a letter (reference <b>[insert your reference number here]</b>) informing me my parcel of Pluslife test kits had been stopped at the border due to not having an import permit. I did not realise these items needed an import permit when I bought them, so do not have a permit for them.

              </p>

              <p>
                  I am aware of other individuals who were able to receive their Pluslife test kits by providing information confirming that the test kits were for personal use only, and are no more than a 3 month supply. Does this apply in my case? If so, please let me know what information I need to provide, and I shall provide it.
              </p>

              <p>
                  If not, it would be much appreciated if you could please have my parcel returned to sender. Thank you!
              </p>

                  Hello!
              </p>

              <p>
                  My order <b>[insert your order number here]</b> was unfortunately denied entry into Australia and sent back to you due to not meeting import requirements.

              </p>

              <p>
                  If the order ends up arriving back to you with all goods still intact, would it be possible for you to give me a refund?
              </p>
