          <h1 id="header">Ordering Pluslife Tests to Australia: An Overview</h1>
          <i>The following points are explained in detail and referenced appropriately on the FAQ page :) </i>
          <p>
              To summarise the current legal status of ordering Pluslife tests into Australia:
          </p>

          <ul>
              <li>
                  <b>All Pluslife tests compatible with the Pluslife MiniDock require an import permit to be legally brought into Australia from overseas.</b> This includes small orders for personal use.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  <b>Bringing Pluslife tests into Australia without an import permit may constitute a criminal offence or civil breach.</b>
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  The above two points are not well-known due to Pluslife distributors (eg. <a href="https://altruan.com/collections/pluslife">Altruan</a>, <a href="https://www.ngaio.co.nz/2025/01/pluslife-revolutionizing-molecular-point-of-care-poc-testing">Ngaio Diagnostics</a>) historically being able to deliver tests to Australia without issue.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  However, since late April 2025 multiple orders of Pluslife tests have been stopped at customs and denied entry into Australia due to them arriving without an import permit (including mine). This situation brought the legal requirement of an import permit to light.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  Import permits can be applied for via a quick application process, and are approved swiftly (mine took less than 24 hours). They cost $204 per permit (as of 15/05/2025), and last 5 years.
              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  There is no limit on the number of tests or orders a permit holder can make using their permit. You are allowed to use one import permit to order tests for multiple people, so long as the name and address on the order matches the name and address on the import permit.

              </li>
              <br />

              <li>
                  If you have an order of tests already in transit and it is stopped at the border without a permit, your order will either be destroyed or returned to sender. In my case, my order was successfully returned to Altruan and refunded - however, this can only happen if your order actually makes it back to the sender, which is not guaranteed.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                  I personally was successful in ordering Pluslife tests into the country at the end of May 2025 using an import permit and the methods discussed on this website. Yay!!
              </li>
